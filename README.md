# Articles on Asp.net Web Api

Once i tried to write a book about Web Api. I wrote only 2 chapters which are listed below:

* [Message Handlers & Filters](https://github.com/chisty/asp.net-web-api-articles/master/message-handlers-and-filters.md)
* [Serialization and Model Binding] (../master/serialization-and-model-binding.md)
